# This is the Genesys Web Messaging test runner used by Maximus Canada.

# The code in index.html was generated by Genesys. The instructions for this are available on [their website](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/deploy-messenger/). You'll notice that the src folder for this project is empty; this is because the required code is all handled on Genesys's end in the index.html file. The rest of the project, including server.js, exists to faciliate this page being hosted/served so sites such as Cherwell can embed it. 

# At the time of writing, this project is being hosted on Openshift at [this link](https://genesys-3a0694-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/) and embedded by other sites as needed. If a new Genesys deployment is made and needs to be rolled out down the road, this can be done by anyone with access to the [SBC Github Repository](https://github.com/bcgov/sbc-maximus-services).

# Due to the anticipated infrequency of code updates for this project, it was decided that Cherwell and other sites could embed directly from the dev environment. If this needs to change down the road, the project can be deployed in other environments (eg. test, prod) as well.
